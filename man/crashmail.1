.SH DESCRIPTION
Welcome to CrashMail II! CrashMail II is basically a more portable version
of CrashMail, my tosser for Amiga computers. Users of the old Amiga
version will probably find some things familiar while some features are
gone such as the ARexx port (for obvious reasons!) and the GUI
configuration editor. The only feature that CrashMail II has and the old
CrashMail hasn't is support for JAM messagebases.

.SH BUGS
.SS Win32
If you want to use an old reader that only can handle 8+3 filenames,
you have to use %8 in the path of your
.I DEFAULT
area if you are using the auto-add feature.
This creates an 8 digit serial number to use as the path for the area.
Note that if CrashMail is run twice in a short period of time (a few seconds),
it might create duplicate paths.
Avoid %8 if it is at all possible.
.SS Linux
Don't use the ~ character in paths. Such paths are expanded to point
to your home directory by the shell and not by the i/o functions in
the system. They will not work in CrashMail.
.PP
In *.msg areas, make sure that all files are named *.msg and not *.MSG!
If they are not named in lowercase, CrashMail will not export them.
.PP
As an extra bonus, the Linux version of CrashMail can use the syslog instead
of using its own log file. Just use "syslog" as the name of your log file.
.PP
If the precompiled binaries in the CrashMail archive don't work on your
system, you will have to compile your own. See
.I src/ReadMe.txt
for more information about this.
