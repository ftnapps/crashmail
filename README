============
Introduction
============
Welcome to CrashMail II! CrashMail II is basically a more portable version
of CrashMail, a tosser for Amiga computers. Users of the old Amiga
version will probably find some things familiar while some features are
gone such as the ARexx port (for obvious reasons!) and the GUI
configuration editor. The only feature that CrashMail II has and the old
CrashMail hasn't is support for JAM messagebases.

Acknowledgements
================
Many thanks to Björn Stenberg for creating the excellent subroutine library
JAMLIB which CrashMail uses for handling JAM messagebases.

Thanks for Peter Karlsson for porting CrashMail II to OS/2 and the man pages.

Thanks to Lars Kellogg-Stedman for the testing scripts as well as the other
improvements he has made.


=============
Documentation
=============
The documentation is very brief and CrashMail probably isn't the ideal
choice for Fidonet beginners. All documentation of the available keywords
in the configuration file can be found in the doc/example.prefs file, and
other information can be found in the doc/ReadMe.txt file..


=========
Platforms
=========
This version of CrashMail can be compiled for Win32, Linux and OS/2; see the
INSTALL file for details. If you are interested in running CrashMail on another
platform, please contact me if you are willing to do the work necessary to adapt
CrashMail to your platform. The amount of work required mostly depends on whether
your C-compiler supports some common POSIX-functions which CrashMail uses.
