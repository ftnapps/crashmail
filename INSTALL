How to compile:

For win32 and os2 targets: first create a bin/ and src/obj/ directories.
Then just type

 make linux 
or
 make win32
or 
 make os2

depending on the platform which you want to compile CrashMail for. You will 
now find the binaries in the 'bin' directory.

If you want to remove all object files that were created during the compilation,
type

 make cleanlinux
or
 make cleanwin32
or
 make cleanos2

Note: CrashMail was developed using gcc. If you are using another compiler, you
will probably have to make some adjustments to the makefiles and perhaps also 
to the source.
